        <p>These cranberry Brie bites are an appetizer that will surely wow your guests at any party or holiday function. Tangy cranberry, creamy Brie, and crunchy walnuts come together in a buttery puff pastry shell, delivering the perfect balance of flavor and texture in every bite.</p> 

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-ounce round of Brie</li>
            <li>Puff pastry</li>
            <li>Cranberry sauce</li>
            <li>Walnuts</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll: Roll the puff pastry into a rectangle.</li>
            <li>Cut: Place your Brie in the freezer for about 20 minutes to make it easier to cut. Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to cut the puff pastry into even squares. Remove the Brie from the freezer and cut it into even pieces.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Press the pastry squares into an oiled muffin tin. Spoon each square with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, then top with the Brie. Sprinkle with walnuts and a pinch of sea salt.</li>
            <li>Chill: Transfer the cranberry Brie bites to the fridge and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake in a preheated oven until golden brown.</li>
